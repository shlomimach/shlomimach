ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m  Shlomi Machluf [@shlomimach]

At 32, living in Yavne with my spouse and two children, my journey from a high school graduate of the "ADERET" Yeshiva in Bat Yam,
through military service in logistics and computing, to a brief stint as a clothing store owner, has been diverse and enriching.

The pivotal moment came post-military service, when I pursued my passion for technology by enrolling in a comprehensive 1200-hour .NET development course.
Fortuitously, I joined 'Twoteam' Company - a leading company in the insurance and finance sector - immediately after completing my course.
My role evolved rapidly, progressing from developer to Tech-lead, handling increasingly complex projects over my 8-year tenure,
specializing in C# and .NET for desktop applications.

Despite my successes, I recognized the need to update my technological skills,
propelling me into self-study of web application development, embracing GitHub, Angular, .NET CORE, among other technologies.
This self-driven learning has led to the development of AI-based software and numerous other projects, some of which are web-based.

In leveraging my diverse background, I aim to infuse my projects on GitHub with the depth of experience I've gained.
From implementing sophisticated algorithms in AI-based software to pioneering web application development with the latest technologies,
each project reflects my journey and passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in software development.


I am keen to share more about my professional journey and experiences.
