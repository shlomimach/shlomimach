👋 Hi, I'm Shlomi Machluf [@shlomimach]

At 33, living in Yavne with my spouse and two children, my journey from a high school graduate of the "ADERET" Yeshiva in Bat Yam, through military service in logistics and computing, to a brief stint as a clothing store owner, has been diverse and enriching.

The pivotal moment came post-military service, when I pursued my passion for technology by enrolling in a comprehensive 1200-hour .NET development course. Fortuitously, I joined 'Twoteam' Company - a leading company in the insurance and finance sector - immediately after completing my course.

My role at Twoteam evolved rapidly, progressing from developer to Tech-lead over my 8.5-year tenure. I specialized in C# and .NET for desktop applications, while also leading the transition to Angular and .NET Core for web development. During this time, I developed automation software that reduced bugs by 99% and built AI-based bots for customer service.

Recognizing the need to continually update my technological skills, I embraced self-study in web application development, mastering technologies like GitHub, Angular, and .NET Core. This self-driven learning culminated in a recent intensive 3-month MERN Fullstack course, where I completed five complex, large-scale projects.

Currently, I'm serving as a senior Fullstack developer in the IDF's unit (reserves), leading the development of a strategic project using React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. This role allows me to apply and expand my expertise in Agile methodologies, Clean Code practices, and UX optimization.

In addition to my technical roles, I've embarked on an entrepreneurial journey, founding a unique computer college for seniors. This initiative combines my passion for technology with a desire to make it accessible to older adults, developing tailored curricula and leading digital marketing campaigns to grow the student base and community engagement.

In leveraging my diverse background, I aim to infuse my projects on GitHub with the depth of experience I've gained. From implementing sophisticated algorithms in AI-based software to pioneering web application development with the latest technologies, each project reflects my journey and passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in software development.

I am keen to share more about my professional journey and experiences. Feel free to visit my LinkedIn profile at [www.linkedin.com/in/shlomi-machluf-54b2a815b](www.linkedin.com/in/shlomi-machluf-54b2a815b).

I welcome any feedback, questions, or comments you may have!

👋 היי, אני שלומי מכלוף [@shlomimach]

בן 33, מתגורר ביבנה עם בת זוגי ושני ילדיי. המסע שלי מבוגר ישיבת "אדרת" בבת ים, דרך שירות צבאי בלוגיסטיקה ומחשוב, ועד לתקופה קצרה כבעל חנות בגדים, היה מגוון ומעשיר.

נקודת המפנה הגיעה לאחר השירות הצבאי, כשהחלטתי לממש את התשוקה שלי לטכנולוגיה והצטרפתי לקורס פיתוח .NET מקיף של 1200 שעות. למזלי, מיד לאחר סיום הקורס הצטרפתי לחברת 'Twoteam' - חברה מובילה בתחום הביטוח והפיננסים.

התפקיד שלי ב-Twoteam התפתח במהירות, מתפקיד מפתח ועד ל-Tech-lead במהלך 8.5 שנות עבודתי שם. התמחיתי ב-C# ו-.NET לאפליקציות דסקטופ, תוך כדי הובלת המעבר ל-Angular ו-.NET Core לפיתוח אפליקציות ווב. במהלך תקופה זו, פיתחתי תוכנות אוטומציה שהפחיתו באגים ב-99% ובניתי בוטים מבוססי AI לשירות לקוחות.

מתוך הכרה בצורך להתעדכן באופן מתמיד במיומנויות טכנולוגיות, יזמתי למידה עצמית בפיתוח אפליקציות ווב, תוך שליטה בטכנולוגיות כמו GitHub, Angular ו-.NET Core. הלמידה העצמית הזו הגיעה לשיאה בקורס MERN Fullstack אינטנסיבי של 3 חודשים, שבו השלמתי חמישה פרויקטים מורכבים בקנה מידה גדול.

כיום, אני משרת כמפתח Fullstack בכיר ביחידה של צה"ל (במילואים), מוביל את הפיתוח של פרויקט אסטרטגי תוך שימוש ב-React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Prisma ו-PostgreSQL. תפקיד זה מאפשר לי ליישם ולהרחיב את המומחיות שלי במתודולוגיות Agile, פרקטיקות של Clean Code ואופטימיזציה של חווית המשתמש.

בנוסף לתפקידים הטכניים שלי, יצאתי למסע יזמי והקמתי מכללת מחשבים ייחודית לגיל השלישי. יוזמה זו משלבת את התשוקה שלי לטכנולוגיה עם הרצון להנגיש אותה למבוגרים, תוך פיתוח תכניות לימודים מותאמות אישית והובלת קמפיינים שיווקיים דיגיטליים להגדלת בסיס הסטודנטים והמעורבות הקהילתית.

בהסתמך על הרקע המגוון שלי, אני שואף להטמיע בפרויקטים שלי ב-GitHub את עומק הניסיון שצברתי. החל מיישום אלגוריתמים מתוחכמים בתוכנות מבוססות AI ועד לחלוציות בפיתוח אפליקציות ווב עם הטכנולוגיות העדכניות ביותר, כל פרויקט משקף את המסע שלי ואת התשוקה שלי לדחוף את גבולות האפשרי בפיתוח תוכנה.

אני נלהב לשתף עוד על המסע המקצועי והחוויות שלי. אתם מוזמנים לבקר בפרופיל הלינקדאין שלי ב-[www.linkedin.com/in/shlomi-machluf-54b2a815b](www.linkedin.com/in/shlomi-machluf-54b2a815b).

אשמח לכל משוב, שאלה או הערה שיש לכם!
